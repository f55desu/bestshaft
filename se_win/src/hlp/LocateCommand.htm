   // TO DO: Describe your command here.</P>
  <P>
   This command locates reference planes and parts. It performs no 
   useful function as far as the user is concerned other than to 
   demonstrate that the add-in has successfully been connected to Solid 
   Edge, can be invoked, and can locate reference planes and parts. It 
   performs no manipulation of the located entities.</P>
